## Design plans
- `Rouglite elements` 
  - Items, upgrades
  - level up between levels
  - progression across runs
  - Pick build at start 
    - Different magic and melee builds 
    - Maybe hybrid type beat
    
- `Combat` 
  - Swords, magic 
  - Build based (See rouglite)
  - Fast paced

- `Platforming` 
  - Juicy movement
  - Good vert, climbing up, ascending the tower  
  - Weapons and magic integrate into movement 
    - Rocket jump but its with magic or a sword 
  - Wall jump, other abilities powered by weapons 

- `Potential gimmick`
  - as we ascend the map, we move forward in time. Tech gets more futuristic
    - stages are maybe time warps?

## Visuals 
- `Player` 
  - As we upgrade the armor, it gets cooler (more futuristic) 

- World 
  -
- Items
  -
