## Name stuff 
"Rising Valor"
- Fitting for its riffing on the ascension theme. Fitting as the player is both ascending the tower and growing
in strength along the journey. Valor calls back to our heroes core, noble motivations.

i think the knight saving a damsel would be cliche so maybe
like some kinda philosophers stone would be cool. Gives you a goal and a boss to defeat who is guarding it
​then you learn maybe the first half of it was at the top of the tower and once you have the second 
you can open a portal to hell back in the dungeon to get the second half
​once you have the first half you can open a portal*

​I imagine right this world is probably not doin so hot and you were sent with the goal to get magic plot device item that could save humanity. Maybe it's an orb that grants wishes or somethin
@KogamSPACE
​and its guarded
@alyssaaalyssaaalyssaaalyssa
​can we have someone trapped in the orb
@alyssaaalyssaaalyssaaalyssa
​NOT a damsel
@KogamSPACE
​king?
@KogamSPACE
​kidnapped your king or father and you have to rescue him
@KogamSPACE
@alyssaaalyssaaalyssaaalyssa
​king might be good
@alyssaaalyssaaalyssaaalyssa
​if you cant save him you become the king
@KogamSPACE
​i'd say if you DO save him you become the king. Like he retires. If you fail the world ends type shit

## Design plans
- `Rouglite elements` 
  - Items, upgrades
  - level up between levels
  - progression across runs
  - Pick build at start 
    - Different magic and melee builds 
    - Maybe hybrid type beat
    
- `Combat` 
  - Swords, magic 
  - Build based (See rouglite)
  - Fast paced

- `Platforming` 
  - Juicy movement
  - Good vert, climbing up, ascending the tower  
  - Weapons and magic integrate into movement 
    - Rocket jump but its with magic or a sword 
  - Wall jump, other abilities powered by weapons 

- `Potential gimmick`
  - as we ascend the map, we move forward in time. Tech gets more futuristic
    - stages are maybe time warps?

## Enemies
Phil Fish inspired name for enemy 
- Phylfesh the wizard
- Fish named Phil

## Visuals 
- `Player` 
  - As we upgrade the armor, it gets cooler (more futuristic) 

- World 
  -
- Items
  -
