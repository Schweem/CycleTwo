# Goals for the week 

[] - Decide what game we are going to keep making on stream

[] - Bring dialouge trees from sandbox into full project

[] - Finish all of the gnomes

[] - Combat system. Decided and starting to be implemented. 

[] - Nastrond design

## What does that look like 
*Dialouge Trees:* Bringing the three classes from sandboxed project into the main game. 
Use the actor class from this project instead, create a better system for writting and 
assigning the dialouge option classes. 

*Finish the gnomes:* Visually finish the last two sprites, begin to flesh out their dialouge or otherwise unqiue functions. (Quests, shops, etc) This can be in basic form but do *something*.

*Combat system:* Finalize how the player will attack and what combat looks like, start making that happen and getting it feeling good. 

*Nastrond design:* Make him in aseprite, simple.
