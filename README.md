# Untitled Midevil Rougelite #6001
New game project! Unsure of plan or scope, something to work on for content and fun. 

![The game so far](/docs/media/helloWorld.png)

For a better writeup see:
- [Ideas doc](/docs/ideas.md)
- [Spec doc](/docs/specs.md)

## Features (Planned):
- `Rouglite elements` 
  - Items, upgrades
  - level up between levels
  - progression across runs
  - Pick build at start 
    - Different magic and melee builds 
    - Maybe hybrid type beat
    
- `Combat` 
  - Swords, magic 
  - Build based (See rouglite)
  - Fast paced

- `Platforming` 
  - Juicy movement
  - Good vert, climbing up, ascending the tower  
  - Weapons and magic integrate into movement 
    - Rocket jump but its with magic or a sword 
  - Wall jump, other abilities powered by weapons 

- `Potential gimmick`
  - as we ascend the map, we move forward in time. Tech gets more futuristic
    - stages are maybe time warps?
